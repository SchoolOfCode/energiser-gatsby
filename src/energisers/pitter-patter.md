A cross between tennis and basket ball.

Played in pairs, use a medium sized bouncy foam ball and keep it alive but hitting it from player to player.

## Rules

- Only 1 consecutive hit for each player.
- Only one bounce is allowed on the floor.

## Aim

Set up a route e.g. ball must touch this wall, then go through this gap, then hit this wall and finish by hitting this chair.

Shortest time taken to complete the course wins.
