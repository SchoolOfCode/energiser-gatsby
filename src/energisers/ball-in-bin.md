Set up three targets which you can throw things into. 1 close worth 10 points, 1 medium worth 20 points, 1 far worth 50 points.

## timed mode

- 30s to score as much points as possible.

## other mode

- take it in turns to take a shot at the 10 point target.
- if you get it in you get another shot and you are now allowed to shoot for the 20 points.
- if you get that in you can now shoot for the 50.
- if you miss then its the next persons go.
