Set up three targets which you can throw things into. 1 close worth 10 points, 1 medium worth 20 points, 1 far worth 50 points.

## Timed mode

- Each player has 30s to score as many points as possible.

## Other mode

- take it in turns to take a shot at the 10 point target.
- if successful then you get another which can now be at the 10 point or the 20 point bin.
- if successful again then you can now shoot for all three bins.
- if you miss then its the next persons go.
