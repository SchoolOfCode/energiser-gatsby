title: "Cups Tower Competition"
---

Set team members at short intervals apart in a straigt line using an x-mark with tape, with two people at the start and one person at each following interval.

Have the first two people build a cup tower with 10 cups. Then they must transport it to the next person. If it falls they must stop and rebuild before carrying on.

At each interval, they must collapse the tower and rebuild. They must continue until they reach the end, and can use each extra person to help transport to the next interval.

Winner is the team that gets it to the last person in the quickest time.

rules:

- Team members can help balance cups, but can not physically hold the cups, other than at the base of the tower.
- Depending on your time frame/number of teams, you may want to have more/less intervals as it can take a while.
